# Iris-ML-Model

A basic machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers using petal and sepal data.  
Built with Python and scikit-learn as part of my ML learning journey.

##  What it does

Trains an SVM model on the Iris dataset to predict the species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).  
Achieved 100% accuracy on the test set — classic dataset, but good practice.


##  Tools Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
